## Work & Research
(The following work is finished as main contributor,some work is publish-limited)


#### Hybrid robot consisit of 18-DOF legged robot + robotic arm


 The entire system consists of a 12-DOF wheel-legged robot + 6-DOF robotic arm. The legged robot adopts a similar algorithmic framework as ETH and uses Acados nonlinear MPC control. Floating base kinematic dynamics are employed to achieve 18-DOF full-body Jacobian non-space control and whole-body grasping. It can achieve balance obstacle crossing and chicken head stability.
